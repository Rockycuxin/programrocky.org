内容（ 在电脑上看 ）：
The little boy went down the street and said no to the monster in the well cover.
Then the little boy went to the maze field.
Then four elephants held up the big roof.
Then to a mysterious place, he said: OH! THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!
Then the little boy was swinging the hot air balloon.
The little boy is number one among the many hot air balloons.
Who knows, hot air balloon siking on a tree!
He walked, all the way to a disgusting cave.
Leaving the cave, he went to a town that could not be explained.
The lights inside are on for 1 second, one second off.
After entering, he went to a mysterious place--- The Waiting Place.
Everyone inside is doing an action: just wait.
Everyone is just waiting.
He went to a band practice area and found that 100% of the people inside were practicing music.
I saw him walk up to an elephant and ride up.
He came to the court, played, and at last he was the winner.
Then he found himself playing basketball in a very strange makeshift home.
He came to a very strange door, next to the monster.
He left, met Hakken-Kraks on his way to the boat, and seemed to be screaming.
He went to a cave again, saw a monster, he bravely touched it, and then a flock of birds passed, he went around, and then he dragged a city away.
Finally, he went home.
